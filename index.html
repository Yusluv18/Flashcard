            <h1 class="question2">JQuery?</h1>
            <p class="definition2">JQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies tasks like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.</p>

            <h1 class="question3">Function?</h1>
            <p class="definition3">A function in JavaScript is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help organize your code, making it more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flash1" id="card">
            <h1 class="question4">Variable?</h1>
            <p class="definition4">A variable in JavaScript is a container for storing data. It allows developers to label and store values in memory, which can then be used and manipulated throughout the code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flash2" id="card">
            <h1 class="question5">Operators?</h1>
            <p class="definition5">An operator in JavaScript is a symbol or keyword used to perform operations on values (operands). Operators allow you to manipulate data, compare values, perform arithmetic, assign values, and more.</p>

            <p class="definition7">Comments in JavaScript are non-executable lines of text in the code that provide explanations, notes, or additional context. They are ignored by the JavaScript engine during execution and are primarily for developers to make the code easier to understand and maintain.</p>

            <h1 class="question9">Boolean?</h1>
            <p class="definition9">A Boolean in JavaScript is a data type that represents one of two possible values: true or false. Booleans are fundamental in programming as they form the basis for decision-making and logic, often used in conditions and comparisons.</p>
